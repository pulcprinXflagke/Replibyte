# How to Find Your VisTitle Serial Number
 
VisTitle is a powerful title software that works as a plug-in for EDIUS. It allows you to create subtitles, 3D animations, and complex compositing with ease. If you have bought VisTitle 2.x in the licence version (i.e. with online activation, NOT the USB dongle version), you can directly install version 2.9, which is compatible with EDIUS X. However, if you have the USB dongle version, you need to swap it to a serial number licence in order to get updates and use VisTitle with EDIUS X.
 
Here are the steps to find your VisTitle serial number and swap it from a dongle to a digital licence:

5. You will receive a new serial number for the digital version of VisTitle.
